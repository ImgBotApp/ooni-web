<h1 id="risks-things-you-should-know-before-using-ooniprobe:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Risks: Things you should know before using ooniprobe</h1>

<p>OONI&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-probe">software tests</a> (called
ooniprobe) are designed to test networks for signs of censorship, surveillance
and traffic manipulation. In some countries around the world using ooniprobe may
result in criminal prosecution, fines, or even imprisonment. We therefore
strongly urge you to consult with a lawyer licensed to practice in your country
<em>prior</em> to downloading, installing and running ooniprobe, and to carefully read
the documentation below.</p>

<p>Users run ooniprobe at their own risk. By installing ooniprobe, users agree to
comply with OONI&rsquo;s software
<a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-%20probe/blob/master/LICENSE">license</a>
and <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/about/data-policy">Data Policy</a>. Neither the
<a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">OONI project</a> nor its parent organization, <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">The Tor Project</a>, can be held liable, jointly or
severally, at law or at equity, to ooniprobe users and other third parties, for
any risks or damages resulting from the use of ooniprobe under any tort,
contract, or other causes of action.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The risks described below are quite speculative. To our
knowledge, no ooniprobe user has ever faced consequences from the risks
described below. Nonetheless, we strongly encourage you to read the following
information regarding potential risks associated with the use of ooniprobe.</p>

<h2 id="potential-penalties-and-sanctions:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Potential Penalties and Sanctions</h2>

<p>In some countries, any form of active network measurement may be illegal, or
even considered a form of espionage.</p>

<p>Many governments have a lengthy history of subjecting digital rights activists to
various forms of abuse that may make it dangerous for individuals in these
countries to run ooniprobe. The use of ooniprobe may therefore subject users
to severe civil, criminal, or extra-judicial penalties. Such sanctions can
potentially include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Imprisonment</p></li>

<li><p>Physical assaults</p></li>

<li><p>Large fines</p></li>

<li><p>Threats</p></li>

<li><p>Placement on government watch lists</p></li>

<li><p>Targeting for surveillance</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In view of these threats, we strongly encourage you to consult with a lawyer and
to understand the legal risks prior to using ooniprobe. Potential risks of using
ooniprobe are detailed below.</p>

<h2 id="risks-detection-of-ooniprobe:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Risks: Detection of ooniprobe</h2>

<p>Certain users may face severe penalties if these users are detected by third
parties (such as governments) who view ooniprobe as a threat.</p>

<p>The use of ooniprobe may be detected by third parties through the following:</p>

<h3 id="surveillance:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Surveillance</h3>

<p>Third parties (such as your government, your internet service provider, or your
employer) may be monitoring some or all of your internet activity. This may
allow them to detect the web traffic generated by your use of ooniprobe and to
link it back to you personally.</p>

<p>Many countries employ sophisticated surveillance measures that allow governments
to track individuals&rsquo; online activities â€“ even if they are using privacy-
preserving services such as Tor, Psiphon, virtual private networks (VPNs), or
proxy servers. In such countries, governments or third parties may be able to
identify you as an ooniprobe user regardless of what measures you take to
protect your online privacy.</p>

<h3 id="tested-services:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Tested services</h3>

<p>The services ooniprobe connects to will be able to see your IP address and may be
able to detect that you are using ooniprobe. You can view which services ooniprobe tests
<a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="physical-or-remote-access-to-a-user-s-device:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Physical or remote access to a user&rsquo;s device</h3>

<p>As with any other software, the usage of ooniprobe can leave traces. As such,
anyone with physical or remote access to your computer may be able to see
that you have downloaded, installed or run ooniprobe.</p>

<h3 id="publication-of-measurements:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Publication of measurements</h3>

<p>By default, all measurements generated through ooniprobe are sent to OONI&rsquo;s
measurement collector and automatically published through:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://explorer.ooni.torproject.org/world/">OONI Explorer</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://measurements.ooni.torproject.org/">OONI&rsquo;s measurements interface</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, the public - including third parties who view the usage of
ooniprobe as a threat - will be able to see all user measurements, unless users
<strong><a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/about/data-policy/">opt out</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Published data will include your approximate location, the network (ASN) you are
connecting from, and the time when you ran ooniprobe. Other identifying
information, such as your IP address, is <em>not</em> deliberately collected, but may
be included in HTTP headers or other metadata. The full page content downloaded
by ooniprobe may include such information if, for example, a website includes
tracking codes or custom content based on your network location. Identifying
information could potentially aid third parties in detecting you as an ooniprobe
user.</p>

<h2 id="risks-ooniprobe-tests:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Risks: ooniprobe tests</h2>

<p>OONI has developed multiple free software tests, each one of which is designed
to perform a different function. Therefore these tests potentially entail different
types of risks to the user.</p>

<p>Generally, ooniprobe is designed to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Examine whether websites are blocked;</p></li>

<li><p>Examine whether instant messaging (IM) apps (such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger) are blocked;</p></li>

<li><p>Detect the presence of systems which may be responsible for censorship,
surveillance and traffic manipulation;</p></li>

<li><p>Examine whether censorship circumvention tools, such as <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/">Tor
bridges</a>, <a href="https://psiphon.ca/">Psiphon</a> and
<a href="https://getlantern.org/">Lantern</a>, are blocked.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We urge you to review the
<strong><a href="https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/tree/master/test-specs">specifications</a></strong>
for each ooniprobe test carefully, prior to running them.</p>

<h3 id="legality-of-tested-websites:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Legality of tested websites</h3>

<p>When running OONI&rsquo;s <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/web-connectivity/">web connectivity test</a> you will connect to and download data from various websites
which are included in the following two lists:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists">Country-specific test list</a></strong>
(search for your country&rsquo;s test list based on its country code)</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv">Global test list</a></strong>
(including a list of globally accessed websites)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Many websites included in the above lists are controversial and may include
pornography or hate speech. This content may be illegal to access in your
country. In some countries, accessing illegal content has severe consequences,
such as imprisonment. We therefore recommend that you carefully examine whether
you are willing to take the risk of accessing and downloading data from such
websites through ooniprobe tests.</p>

<p>If you are uncertain of the potential implications of connecting to and
downloading data from the websites listed in the above lists, you can choose
which websites to test by running <code>ooniprobe web_connectivity -u &lt;url&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3 id="legality-of-ooniprobe-tests:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Legality of ooniprobe tests</h3>

<p>Some network tests performed by ooniprobe may violate your country&rsquo;s computer
misuse laws or terms of service of your internet provider.</p>

<p>Specifically, the operators of network components affected by ooniprobe tests
may view these tests as attacks. OONI&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/http-invalid-request-line/">HTTP-invalid-request-line</a></strong> test,
for example, <em>might</em> trigger suspicion when sending out-of-spec messages to an
echo service and could be viewed as a form of &ldquo;hacking&rdquo;. If network components
affected by this test view these out-of-spec messages as attacks, you may face
severe consequences, such as prosecution under computer misuse laws.</p>

<h3 id="legality-of-anonymity-software:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Legality of anonymity software</h3>

<p>By default, ooniprobe network measurements are sent to OONI&rsquo;s measurement
collector through the use of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services">Tor hidden services</a> which are designed
for online anonymity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, OONI&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/vanilla-tor/">Vanilla Tor</a></strong> test is designed to examine the reachability of the Tor network, while
OONI&rsquo;s <strong><a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/tor-bridge-reachability/">bridge-reachability</a></strong> test is designed to check whether <a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/">Tor bridges</a> are blocked or not. Both tests require
the installation of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor software</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, the following OONI tests require the installation of circumvention
software:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/psiphon/">Psiphon</a></strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/lantern/">Lantern</a></strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>We therefore encourage you to consult with a lawyer on the legality of anonymity
software (such as Tor, a VPN or a proxy) in your country <em>prior</em> to running the
above tests and to consider uploading your measurements via HTTPS collectors or
cloud-fronting (instead of Tor hidden services).</p>

<h3 id="third-party-services:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Third-party services</h3>

<p>Our <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/ndt/">Network Diagnostic Test (NDT)</a> is
a general-purpose performance test conducted against third-party servers
provided by <a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/">Measurement Lab (M-Lab)</a>. M-Lab&rsquo;s
NDT services require the retention and disclosure of IP addresses for research
purposes. For more about M-Lab&rsquo;s data governance, see its <a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/privacy/">privacy statement</a>.</p>

<h2 id="seeking-legal-advice:8972da30de206641cfcd8ebb5103328e">Seeking legal advice</h2>

<p>The legal risks of downloading, installing and running ooniprobe can vary from
country to country, which is why we advise you to consult with lawyers who are
licensed to practice in your country.</p>

<p>Some questions you may want to ask your lawyers relating to the use of ooniprobe
include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does my country prohibit me from using:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>network measurement software</strong>?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>censorship detection software</strong>?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>censorship circumvention software</strong>?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>anonymity software</strong>?</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Is it illegal for me to access certain websites?</p></li>

<li><p>Are there laws in my country that require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to
track my online activity?</p></li>

<li><p>Has anyone in my country ever been criminalized based on their internet
activity? (This does not necessarily need to be specific to network
measurements)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note, this is not an exhaustive list of questions to ask your lawyers.</p>

<p>Additionally, while many countries do not have laws specifically prohibiting the
use of network measurement software, the use of ooniprobe may still be
criminalized in certain countries under other, broader laws. For example, using
ooniprobe may be viewed as illegal or anti-government activity. ooniprobe users
may also face the risk of being criminalized on the grounds of <strong>national security</strong>
if the data obtained and published by running ooniprobe is viewed as
&ldquo;jeopardizing&rdquo; the country&rsquo;s external or internal security. You may want to
consult with a lawyer about these matters as well.</p>
